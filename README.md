## About
Test and train reading speed, or rapidly digest a long text.
This program repeatadly prints one word at a time (look below) from a user provided text, centered and conviently placed such that the eyes barely needs to move in order to read each word.

There's by default 200 milliseconds for each word, with additional time whenever there's a comma, full-stop, colon and semicolon.
All these values are editable inside settings.json where you can also change the font.
Additionally, there's an extra arbitrary amount of delay per letter IF the word is longer than 6 letters.
